This is a simple game I created merely meant to show my skills as a developer. I specifically wanted to show my ability to manage state with react and also my ability to work with apis.

### Technology Used

**Frontend**

+ ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=plastic&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB): A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
+ ![React Router DOM](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=plastic&logo=react-router&logoColor=white): Enables seamless client-side routing for easy navigation between different pages within your application.
+ ![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SASS-hotpink.svg?style=plastic&logo=SASS&logoColor=white): A powerful CSS preprocessor that streamlines writing maintainable and efficient styles.

**Backend**

+ ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=plastic&logo=node.js&logoColor=white): A highly efficient JavaScript runtime environment that empowers server-side operations. It enables your application to process data, communicate with databases, and handle user requests.
+ ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=plastic&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB): A popular web framework for building scalable and secure APIs. It simplifies setting up server-side logic and handling different routes within your application.
+ [![Axios](https://img.shields.io/badge/Axios-56A5FF?style=plastic&logo=axios&color=5A29E4)](https://axios-http.com/)
: Simplifies making HTTP requests for fetching data and interacting with APIs from your backend code.

**Testing**

+ ![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jest-56A5FF?style=plastic&logo=jest&color=C21325): A javaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows developers to write and run tests with a simple and clear API, providing features like a built-in test runner, assertion library, and good support for mocking, which simplifies testing asynchronous code.
+ [![Testing-Library](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TestingLibrary-%23E33332?style=plastic&logo=testing-library&logoColor=white)](https://testing-library.com/): "The Testing Library family of libraries is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code."
